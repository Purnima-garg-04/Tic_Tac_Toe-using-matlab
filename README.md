# AudioSense

This repository contains a MATLAB-based AudioSense script that enables users to record, filter, amplify, and analyze an audio signal in the time-domain and visualize its frequency domains.


## Features

ğŸ”¹ Records an audio taking input from user using MATLAB audiorecorder

ğŸ”¹ Applying the gain on audio.

ğŸ”¹ Using a 6th-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a 1 kHz cutoff frequency and amplifying the filtered audio.

ğŸ”¹ Playing back the original, filtered, and amplified audio.

ğŸ”¹ Plot time-domain and frequency-domain representations of the signal.

ğŸ”¹ Saving the audio file as a .wav file
## Software Requirement

ğŸ”¹ Matlab installed in your System

ğŸ”¹ Working microphone for audio recording
## Inputs

ğŸ”¹ Recording Duration - Time(in seconds) to be specified by the user

ğŸ”¹ Gain Values - Customize the gain before and after filtering

ğŸ”¹ Sampling Frequency for FFT - Customizing sampling frequency for FFT of audio signal
## Output

ğŸ”¹ Graph Plot - Time domain visualization of original, filtered, amplified signal and Fourier Transform visualization.

ğŸ”¹ Playback - Listen to original, filtered, amplified audio

ğŸ”¹ File Strorage.
## Real-Life Applications
ğŸ”¹ Speech Enhancement (Noise reduction in voice recordings)

ğŸ”¹ Hearing Aids (Amplification and noise filtering for the hearing impaired)

ğŸ”¹ Music Processing (Filtering and boosting audio signals)

ğŸ”¹ Forensic Audio Analysis (Enhancing unclear recordings)

ğŸ”¹ Smart Assistants & IoT (Improving voice command accuracy)
